This project aims to create a working Habit Tracking app in python using Tkinter for GUI and matplotlib for visual data representation. 

This project is aimed to develop my python skills, familiarity with foreign libraries and also my UI/UX capabilities by creating an app that is not only useful to me but also appealing to use on a daily basis.

The skills this project will likely involve: [note: will append upon changes likely at project finale]

-Python (Tkinter, Tkcalendar, Matplotlib)

-JSON/SQlite (storing habit data)

-Anaconda/Terminal Prompt (Installing packages and creating appropriate development enviroments

-Github/Git (Documenting all my progress via github directly from vscode)

The initial scope for this project aims to be completed by the 21/03/2025 and includes the full completetion of the App with appropriate input and data representation capabilities.
After this updates may occur adding or appending features to improve usability.
